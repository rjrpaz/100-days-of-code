##### Starting kubernetes course on Udemy:

[https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-de-principiante-a-experto](https://www.udemy.com/course/kubernetes-de-principiante-a-experto)

**Today's Progress**: Starting with the first two modules.

**Thoughts:** This is not the first time I do a course on kubernetes. However, the lack of application in a production environment makes me forget easily pretty much everything I learned.

### Day 2: 2020-02-11
##### 2 1/2 modules completed from the kubernetes course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: Starting to deal with pods

**Thoughts:** Using the docker driver allows to make some mental mindmap between pods and containers.


### Day 3: 2020-02-12
##### 1 1/2 modules completed from the kubernetes course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: manifests, tags and replica sets.

**Thoughts:** It very important to manage pods from higher object (like replica sets) instead of manage them directly.


### Day 4: 2020-02-13
##### 2 modules completed from the kubernetes course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: Deployments (finally!). Rollout.

**Thoughts:** Nice approach from course. So important to understand why pods and replica sets should not be handled directly.


### Day 5: 2020-02-14
##### 2 modules completed from the kubernetes course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: I finished deployments. Services and Endpoints. Also, I started with the practical practice with a sample code in golang.

**Thoughts:** I really like this course. This approach adding more and more layers in the kubernetes hierarchy is very clear.

### Day 6: 2020-02-15
##### Sample project for the k8s course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: Sample project almost working. Sample code seems to be not working "as is" on the cloud (AWS).

**Thoughts:** Off course sample code is not going to work first attempt!


### Day 7: 2020-02-16
##### Sample project for the k8s course on Udemy:

**Today's Progress**: Fixed the issue with help from support Telegram group from this course, now project is finally working!.

**Thoughts:** Not having a good machine to test this at home make me spend some money on the cloud provider. Though life.

### Day 8: 2020-02-17
##### 2 more modules from the k8s course

**Today's Progress**: Learning about namespaces and context. Also about resource limitation on pods.

**Thoughts:** Namespaces seem to be very helpful to organize resources. I have to learn a lot about architecturing.

### Day 9: 2020-02-18
##### 2 more modules from the k8s course

**Today's Progress**: Learning about limitranges and resource quotas on k8s.

**Thoughts:** Limiting the resources used by the namespaces is a very important topic.
